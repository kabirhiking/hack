- **Generate Health Tips**: The platform provides personalized health tips based on the health data of the user.
- **No Authentication Required**: The platform is open and does not require authentication for public access to health tips.

## Installation

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
Clone the project repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/shasthyasetu.git
cd shasthyasetu
```

### Step 2: Set Up a Virtual Environment
Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv venv
# On Windows
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies
Install the required Python packages from the `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

If you don't have `requirements.txt`, manually install the dependencies:
```bash
pip install django djangorestframework
```

### Step 4: Apply Migrations

```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

### Step 5: Create a Superuser (Optional)
If you want to access the Django admin panel, create a superuser:

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

Follow the prompts to create the superuser credentials.

### Step 6: Run the Server
Start the Django development server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Your API will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/`.

## Setup and Configuration

- **Database**: By default, the project uses **SQLite** as the database.
- **Django REST Framework**: The API is built using **Django REST Framework (DRF)** for easy handling of HTTP requests and responses.

In **`settings.py`**, the **`INSTALLED_APPS`** should include the following:

```python
INSTALLED_APPS = [
    # other apps
    'rest_framework',
    'healthcare',
]
```

## Usage

### 1. Create Health Data
To create health data (e.g., steps, heart rate, or mood) for a user, send a `POST` request to the `/api/health-data/` endpoint with the following body:

#### Request:
```json
{
  "user_id": 1,
  "metric_type": "Steps",
  "value": 7000
}
```

#### Example cURL command:
```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/health-data/ \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"user_id": 1, "metric_type": "Steps", "value": 7000}'
```

#### Expected Response:
```json
{
  "id": 1,
  "user_id": 1,
  "metric_type": "Steps",
  "value": 7000,
  "timestamp": "2024-12-06T12:00:00Z"
}
```

### 2. Generate Health Tips
To generate personalized health tips for a user, send a `POST` request to `/api/health-tips/` with the `user_id`.

#### Request:
```json
{

#### Example cURL command:
```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:8000/api/health-tips/ \
